Feature: Product Management
  As a user
  I want to search for products based on their name
  So that I can find specific products quickly

  Scenario: Searching for a product by name
    Given there are products in the system with various names
    When I search for a product with the name "Smartphone"
    Then I should see a product with the name "Smartphone"
from behave import given, when, then
from service.models import Product

@given('there are products in the system with various names')
def step_impl(context):
    Product.objects.create(name="Smartphone", category="Electronics", price=299.99, availability=True)
    Product.objects.create(name="Laptop", category="Electronics", price=999.99, availability=True)
    Product.objects.create(name="T-shirt", category="Clothing", price=19.99, availability=True)

@when('I search for a product with the name "{product_name}"')
def step_impl(context, product_name):
    context.product = Product.objects.filter(name=product_name).first()

@then('I should see a product with the name "{product_name}"')
def step_impl(context, product_name):
    assert context.product is not None
    assert context.product.name == product_name
