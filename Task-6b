Feature: Product Management
  In order to manage products effectively
  As an admin user
  I want to be able to update product details

  Scenario: Successfully updating a product
    Given a product with ID 1 exists in the system with name "Old Product" and category "Electronics"
    When I update the product with ID 1 to have the name "Updated Product" and category "Home Appliances"
    Then the product's name should be "Updated Product"
    And the product's category should be "Home Appliances"
    And the product's availability should remain "In Stock"
