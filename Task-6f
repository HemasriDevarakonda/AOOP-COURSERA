Feature: Product Management
  As a user
  I want to search for products based on their availability
  So that I can find products that are currently in stock

  Scenario: Searching for available products
    Given there are products in the system with different availability statuses
    When I search for products that are "available"
    Then I should see a list of products that are currently available
from behave import given, when, then
from service.models import Product

@given('there are products in the system with different availability statuses')
def step_impl(context):
    Product.objects.create(name="Smartphone", category="Electronics", price=299.99, availability=True)
    Product.objects.create(name="Laptop", category="Electronics", price=999.99, availability=True)
    Product.objects.create(name="T-shirt", category="Clothing", price=19.99, availability=False)
    Product.objects.create(name="Refrigerator", category="Home Appliances", price=499.99, availability=False)

@when('I search for products that are "{availability}"')
def step_impl(context, availability):
    is_available = availability.lower() == "available"
    context.products = Product.objects.filter(availability=is_available)

@then('I should see a list of products that are currently available')
def step_impl(context):
    for product in context.products:
        assert product.availability is True
