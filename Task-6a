Feature: Product Management
  In order to manage products effectively
  As an admin user
  I want to be able to read product details

  Scenario: Successfully reading a product by ID
    Given there is a product with ID 1 in the system
    When I retrieve the product with ID 1
    Then I should see the product's name as "Sample Product"
    And the product's category should be "Electronics"
    And the product's availability should be "In Stock"
